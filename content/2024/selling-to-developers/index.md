One of the hardest things I know is how to sell to developers.

This is NOT an article for developers. I would like do something different today and write an article for non-developers who's
job it is to sell to developers. My goal is to help you understand how developers think.

## Developers Hate Being Sold To

Developers, and we tend to be a skeptical bunch!
We are not reachable through Google ads, because we have ad blockers. 
We expect software to be free and open source, so we don't pay for it.
We subscribe to a handful of services that we pay next to nothing for, in return for a lot of value.
Everything else we build ourselves.

How do you *sell* to these people?

## The Developer's Dilemma

Weirdly enough, developer products are also the first thing we come up with when we think about starting a business
&mdash; even though there are so many other markets that are easier to sell to!

We like building things so much that we try to sell the things we build to other developers &mdash; **who are just like us**.

I have three pieces of advice for you:

1. Don't build a product for developers.
2. Seriously, don't build a product for developers.
2. Since you will ignore the two pieces of advice, at least learn how marketing to developers works.

## What You Need to Know About Marketing to Developers

Here is the bitter truth. In order to sell to developers...

* You will have to be present in the places where developers hang out.
* You will have to invest a lot of time in community building.
* You will have to be extremely patient.
* There is no shortcut.

What if you don't have the time or the patience? See rule 1 above.

## My Developer Product Journey So Far

Now you might say, "why should I listen to you? Have you ever sold a product to developers?"

I'll let you be the judge of that. Here are a few products that I have built and sold to developers:

### [codeprints](https://codeprints.dev/)

This was a fun little experiment during the pandemic. We sold posters of your GitHub timeline.
The marketing strategy was to post on Reddit and Hacker News. We also had a few "devfluencers" that we sent free prints to.
Overall, it worked well, but mostly because of the novelty effect and "viral" marketing.
It also was my first physical product, and I learned a lot about logistics and shipping.

Read more about codeprints in [this blog post](/2021/codeprints/).

### [lychee](https://lychee.cli.rs/)

This is a tool that I built for myself, because I needed it. It's a command-line tool that checks for broken links in markdown and HTML files. It has become quite popular on GitHub, and companies like Google and Amazon are using it.
However, I never made a dime from it. I reached out to some companies to sponsor the project, but it was very hard to get a response
or to explain why they should sponsor a free tool.

I wrote about [making money with Open Source here](/2021/oss-money/).

### [Analysis Tools](https://analysis-tools.dev/)

{{ figure(src="analysis-tools-homepage.jpg", caption="Homepage of analysis-tools.dev") }}

This is a directory of tools for developers. It's a side project that I started in 2015 (did I tell you that you need to be patient?)
and it has grown to be a popular resource for developers.
Together with two friends, we sell sponsorships and ads on the site, and it's a nice little side income.

I think this project works because it's not a product for developers, but **a product for people who build products for developers**.

Our customers are mostly developer advocates, developer relations folks, and marketing people who want to reach developers.

Sponsoring on Analysis Tools is **extremely cheap** in comparison to other marketing channels like Google ads.
On Google, you can easily spend thousands of dollars per month to hope and reach developers.

{{ figure(src="analysis-tools-list.jpg", caption="Homepage of analysis-tools.dev") }}

On Analysis Tools, you can reach developers for a fraction of that cost. The basic tier is $100 per month, and for that,
you get your logo on the site and in every repo.
Thousands of developers visit the site every month. It's basically a no-brainer to sponsor the site if you build a 
linter, a static code analyzer, or really any other tool that developers use.

Think of it this way: when was the last time these companies had the chance to reach thousands of developers for $100?
What is the total cost of acquisition for a developer? How much would you pay for a developer to try out your tool?

And still...

### Only 50% Of Companies Get It

From the companies that I talked to, only around 20% get it immediately. There
are perhaps 30% that need a little bit of handholding. The other 50% 
see it as an ad placement and want to know the click-through rate.

Let me repeat: It's not about the click-through rate. It's about the branding and the reach.
You will never reach a critical audience if you don't start investing in the developer community.
This is not a one-time thing. You need a lot of exposure until you get noticed and developers start talking about your product.
**If you try to fake it, you won't get far and devs will avoid your product like the plague.**

Your main constraint is not your budget, but the attention of developers!

These folks constantly get bombarded with millions of products out there, and they don't have time to evaluate them all.
They stopped actively looking for new tools a long time ago.

## Building Trust Is The Only Way

What they rely on are a handful of trusted sources that they follow.
Getting into their circle of trust is hard, and for that reason, you need to be patient and invest a lot of time into relationship building.
If you can afford it, hire a developer advocate. A good one is heavily invested into open source and knows how to write for developers.
At the very least, you need to be present in the places where developers hang out. So reach out to open source maintainers in your niche and see if you can collaborate or sponsor their projects. Don't waste cash on Google ads or other traditional marketing channels. Go where the developers are.

I hope this article helped you a little.
Perhaps one of you will reach out to some open source maintainers and sponsor their projects.
At the very least, stop treating developers like any other target group.

There's a plus side to all of this: once you understand that you need to invest in the developer community, you will have a competitive advantage over other companies that don't get it.
