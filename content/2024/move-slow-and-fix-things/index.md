Back when I was a kid from rural Bavaria, I always had the dream to move to the US to run a startup.
Many kids in my generation had that dream.
To me, it felt like the *only* way to combine my two greatest passions: writing code and building things.

Getting older, I grew disillusioned with the narrative around Silicon Valley.
That hockey stick growth, the VC money, the "get rich quick" mentality.
It was one big illusion, but for a long time, I just couldn't explain what rubbed me the wrong way.

Part of what I became increasingly uncomfortable with is the glorification of hustle culture.
That idea that you have to work extremely hard to make it big against all odds.
The other part is that "winner takes it all" mentality and the mindset that you have to move fast and break things to succeed.

I don't think that needs to be the case.

As it turns out, I was always interested in the *exact opposite*.
Sustainable growth, robust solutions, and a long-term mindset.
It's the reason why I've been contributing to open source for 20 years, why I only run small, bootstrapped businesses or non-profits,
and why I focus on writing and knowledge sharing.

What Paul Graham and his VC buddies try to make you believe is that your ultimate goal as a founder should be to build a unicorn.
But when I look at the Ubers and Facebooks and Googles of this world, what I see is greed, gatekeeping, exploiting the system, tracking their users, 
using an abundance of resources, and striking lawsuits against competitors.
These companies do everything in their power to stay on top &ndash; even if that means bending the law or finding legal loopholes.
What kind of role model is that?

## The Other Side

Who is on the "other side"?
The humble minority who builds little things.
These people fight for privacy, build civic tech, try to stay within their means, move slow (or shall I say "deliberately"), and fix things.
They get little attention because their success is not measured in dollars. They don't have a big marketing budget either.
Instead, they focus on the product. They do a lot with very little.
I find that way more inspiring.

It's very rewarding to build something that people love and you can make a solid living from it.
There is no need to risk it all, drop out of college, work ridiculous hours, and break things along the way.
You can build something small and useful instead, without a venture capitalist breathing down your neck.
It's still hard work, but you leave the campsite a little better than you found it.

If you're a kid in high school or college and you dream of running a startup, know that there's another way.

In ["Why to Not Not Start a Startup"](https://paulgraham.com/notnot.html), Paul Graham writes:

> So, paradoxically, if you're too inexperienced to start a startup, what you should do is start one. That's a way more efficient cure for inexperience than a normal job. In fact, getting a normal job may actually make you less able to start a startup, by turning you into a tame animal who thinks he needs an office to work in and a product manager to tell him what software to write.

Let me tell you, that's bullshit. It paints a black and white picture of the world that doesn't exist.
You don't have to decide between starting a startup and working a boring job as a "tame animal" in a cubicle.
There's a whole spectrum of possibilities in between.
For example, you can work for yourself or with a small team, be creative, and come up with your own ideas.

Paul wants you to start a startup because he wants to fund you and make money off of you. His motives are purely egoistical.
If you happen to win the lottery with your idea, both Paul and you get lucky. If you don't, you're left with nothing and Paul gets to write an essay about
the reason you failed so that other people can learn from your silly mistakes.

That's a lot of risk for very little upside.

You might be asking why I pick on Paul Graham so much.
It's because I once admired him and I cherished his essays.
He stands for a worldview that I once believed in and that I now consider to be harmful.
Most of his essays read true on the surface, but once you dig deeper you see that his claims are based on a very narrow worldview and rarely backed by evidence.

## Is All VC Money Bad?

Of course not. But I'd argue that it becomes less and less relevant in today's world.
For example, to build a software product, you don't need a lot of money. There are website builders, cloud hosting, and open source software.
Why would you take on VC money if you're just starting out?
One could argue that you get a lot of value from the network and the business advice that comes with it.
Most of that is freely available online, though. There's a plethora of podcasts, videos, and books on the topic if you're willing to learn.

It's harder, of course, if you build a physical product.
But building physical products has become a lot easier, too, in the last few years.
Maybe you can sell a 3D printed prototype before you scale up production?
Or you can launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund the first batch of products?
There are print-on-demand services for t-shirts, mugs, posters, and books now.
On top of that, there are plenty of brick-and-mortar stores that you can approach with your business idea if you're looking for collaboration.

Say you get wildly successful and you urgently need money to scale, then maybe VC money is one way to go. Or you just take out a loan.
Either way, know that money comes with strings attached. 
Funding might make you have to do things you don't want to do, such as selling out your users or your values.
But oftentimes, if you think about a problem for long enough, maybe you find a way to make a proof of concept work at a smaller scale.

## There is no infinite growth

Ask yourself: What's your true source of motivation? Is it power, money, or fame?
If that is the case, there are more meaningful things in life.
Your self-worth is not tied to building a unicorn. 
It's okay to be 23 and not be a millionaire founder.

Don't sell your moral compass for cheap.
You don't have to jump on the AI bandwagon just because it's the hot new thing.
[At least 144 out of 251 companies](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=W24&tags=Artificial%20Intelligence&tags=AI&tags=Generative%20AI&tags=AI%20Assistant) from the YC W24 batch are building products with "AI".
That's 57% of the batch.
How many of them are actually doing something meaningful with it?
How many will still be around in 5 years? What is the long-lasting value these companies bring to the world?
We're sitting on a huge pile of tech debt and rewarding short-term thinking and hypergrowth.

Sure, Paul will make a profit if one of them hits it big. You can read all about it in his next essay.

But maybe there's a better way.
Maybe it's fine to have a small business with a few users, which pays the bills.
Maybe you don't have to grow.
Maybe you can move slow and fix things.
